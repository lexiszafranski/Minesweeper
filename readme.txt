Other notes: I hope these are specific enough haha, if not feel free to reach out and I can give more specifics. Also, I did not have time to implement the timer. However, I did make the pause button functionable in the sense that it switches from pause to play, so I don't know if I get points for that (hopefully I do).
Thanks so much!!
